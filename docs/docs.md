## Abstract
___
The purpose of this documentation is to serve as a reference for the motivation, background, methods, and results of the GEMSEC project to discover the method of signal transduction in human neuropeptides, to ultimately discover candidate peptides with binding affinity to graphene, as well as to illuminate their mechanism of binding.


## Introduction
___
The overarching aim of this project is to uncover the mechanism of signal transduction in neuropeptides which are experimentally determined to bind to graphene. To determine candidate peptides to be experimented on, we have utilized three principal methods: cross-sequence entropy, PAM30 sequence similarity, and RRM[^1] relative to two known binders, *GrBP5*[^2] and *M6*[^3]

## Background
___

## Methods
___
#### RRM

#### Cross entropy

#### PAM30 Sequence similarity

## Results
___
The final script takes in as input a string representing the filepath of a .csv containing the amino acid sequences to be analyzed, and it will output two .csv files (a similarity table for GrBP5 and M6) in the same directory. To run, navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` file and type:
```
python main.py path/to/sequence/csv 
```
