	abstract = {High-throughput sequencing was previously applied to phage-selected peptides in order to gain insight into the abundance and diversity of isolated peptides. Herein we developed a procedure to efficiently compare the sequences of large numbers of phage-selected peptides for the purpose of identifying target-binding peptide motifs. We applied the procedure to analyze bicyclic peptides isolated against five different protein targets: sortase A, urokinase-type plasminogen activator, coagulation factor XII, plasma kallikrein and streptavidin. We optimized sequence data filters to reduce biases originating from the sequencing method and developed sequence correction algorithms to prevent identification of false consensus motifs. With our strategy, we were able to identify rare target-binding peptide motifs, as well as to define more precisely consensus sequences and sub-groups of consensus sequences. This information is valuable to choose peptide leads for drug development and it facilitates identification of epitopes. We furthermore show that binding motifs can be identified after a single round of phage selection. Such a selection regimen reduces propagation-related bias and may facilitate application of phage display in non-specialized laboratories, as procedures such as bacterial infection, phage propagation and purification are not required.},

A large portion of biomolecular interactions in virtually all cellular processes is mediated by compact interaction modules, referred to as peptide motifs.

In this review, we suggest that there might be over a million instances of peptide motifs in the human proteome. While this staggering number suggests that peptide motifs are numerous and the most understudied functional module in the cell, it also holds great opportunities for new discoveries.},

Numerous reports describe the application of tedious mutation/screening cycles for the improvement of proteins. Recently, knowledge-based approaches have facilitated the prediction of protein properties and the identification of improved mutants. However, epistatic phenomena constitute an obstacle which can impair the predictions in protein engineering. We present an innovative sequence-activity relationship (innov’SAR) methodology based on digital signal processing combining wet-lab experimentation and computational protein design. In our machine learning approach, a predictive model is developed to find the resulting property of the protein when the n single point mutations are permuted (2n combinations). The originality of our approach is that only sequence information and the fitness of mutants measured in the wet-lab are needed to build models. We illustrate the application of the approach in the case of improving the enantioselectivity of an epoxide hydrolase from Aspergillus niger. n = 9 single point mutants of the enzyme were experimentally assessed for their enantioselectivity and used as a learning dataset to build a model. Based on combinations of the 9 single point mutations (29), the enantioselectivity of these 512 variants were predicted, and candidates were experimentally checked: better mutants with higher enantioselectivity were indeed found.},

	abstract = {With a large number of DNA and protein sequences already known, the crucial question is to find out how the biological function of these macromolecules is "written" in the sequence of nucleotides or amino acids. Biological processes in any living organism are based on selective interactions between particular bio-molecules, mostly proteins. The rules governing the coding of a protein's biological function, i.e. its ability to selectively interact with other molecules, are still not elucidated. In addition, with the rapid accumulation of databases of protein primary structures, there is an urgent need for theoretical approaches that are capable of analysing protein structure-function relationships. The Resonant Recognition Model (RRM) [,] is one attempt to identify the selectivity of protein interactions within the amino acid sequence. The RRM [,] is a physico-mathematical approach that interprets protein sequence linear information using digital signal processing methods. In the RRM the protein primary structure is represented as a numerical series by assigning to each amino acid in the sequence a physical parameter value relevant to the protein's biological activity. The RRM concept is based on the finding that there is a significant correlation between spectra of the numerical presentation of amino acids and their biological activity. Once the characteristic frequency for a particular protein function/interaction is identified, it is possible then to utilize the RRM approach to predict the amino acids in the protein sequence, which predominantly contribute to this frequency and thus, to the observed function, as well as to design de novo peptides having the desired periodicities. As was shown in our previous studies of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) peptidic antagonists [,] and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) envelope agonists [,], such de novo designed peptides express desired biological function. This study utilises the RRM computational approach to the analysis of oncogene and proto-oncogene proteins. The results obtained have shown that the RRM is capable of identifying the differences between the oncogenic and proto-oncogenic proteins with the possibility of identifying the "cancer-causing" features within their protein primary structure. In addition, the rational design of bioactive peptide analogues displaying oncogenic or proto-oncogenic-like activity is presented here.},

The existing method relies on the pronounced period three peaks observed in the Fourier power spectrum of the exon regions which are absent in non-coding regions. The authors have abandoned the four sequences all together and adopted a single 'EIIP indicator sequence' which is formed by substituting the electron-ion interaction pseudopotentials (EIIP) of the nucleotides A, G, C and T in the DNA sequence, reducing the computational overhead by 75\%. The power spectrum of this sequence reveals period three peaks for exon regions. Also a number of exons have been identified which exhibit period three peaks when mapped to 'EIIP indicator sequence' and which do not show the same when the binary indicator sequences are employed. We could get better discrimination between exon areas and non-coding areas of a number of genomes when the sequences are mapped to EIIP indicator sequences and the power spectra of the same are taken in a sliding Kaiser window, compared to the existing method using a rectangular window which utilizes binary indicator sequences.},

	abstract = {This study concerns an attempt to establish a new method for predicting antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) which are important to the immune system. Recently, researchers are interested in designing alternative drugs based on AMPs because they have found that a large number of bacterial strains have become resistant to available antibiotics. However, researchers have encountered obstacles in the AMPs designing process as experiments to extract AMPs from protein sequences are costly and require a long set-up time. Therefore, a computational tool for AMPs prediction is needed to resolve this problem. In this study, an integrated algorithm is newly introduced to predict AMPs by integrating sequence alignment and support vector machine- (SVM-) LZ complexity pairwise algorithm. It was observed that, when all sequences in the training set are used, the sensitivity of the proposed algorithm is 95.28\% in jackknife test and 87.59\% in independent test, while the sensitivity obtained for jackknife test and independent test is 88.74\% and 78.70\%, respectively, when only the sequences that has less than 70\% similarity are used. Applying the proposed algorithm may allow researchers to effectively predict AMPs from unknown protein peptide sequences with higher sensitivity.},

However, due to multifunctional properties of several AMP classes, until now there has been no way to perform efficient AMP identification, except through in vitro and in vivo tests. Nevertheless, an indication of activity can be provided by prediction methods. In order to contribute to the AMP prediction field, the CS-AMPPred (Cysteine-Stabilized Antimicrobial Peptides Predictor) is presented here, consisting of an updated version of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for antimicrobial activity prediction in cysteine-stabilized peptides. The CS-AMPPred is based on five sequence descriptors: indexes of (i) α-helix and (ii) loop formation; and averages of (iii) net charge, (iv) hydrophobicity and (v) flexibility. CS-AMPPred was based on 310 cysteine-stabilized AMPs and 310 sequences extracted from PDB. The polynomial kernel achieves the best accuracy on 5-fold cross validation (85.81\%), while the radial and linear kernels achieve 84.19\%. Testing in a blind data set, the polynomial and radial kernels achieve an accuracy of 90.00\%, while the linear model achieves 89.33\%. The three models reach higher accuracies than previously described methods. A standalone version of CS-AMPPred is available for download at {\textless}http://sourceforge.net/projects/csamppred/{\textgreater} and runs on any Linux machine.},

	abstract = {Biological processes in any living organism are based on selective interactions between particular biomolecules. In most cases, these interactions involve and are driven by proteins which are the main conductors of any living process within the organism. The physical nature of these interactions is still not well known. This paper represents a whole new view to biomolecular interactions, in particular protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, based on the assumption that these interactions are electromagnetic in their nature. This new approach is incorporated in the Resonant Recognition Model (RRM), which was developed over the last 10 years. It has been shown initially that certain periodicities within the distribution of energies of delocalized electrons along a protein molecule are critical for protein biological function, i.e., interaction with its target. If protein conductivity was introduced, then a charge moving through protein backbone can produce electromagnetic irradiation or absorption with spectral characteristics corresponding to energy distribution along the protein. The RRM enables these spectral characteristics, which were found to be in the range of infrared and visible light, to be calculated. These theoretically calculated spectra were proved using experimentally obtained frequency characteristics of some light-induced biological processes. Furthermore, completely new peptides with desired spectral characteristics, and consequently corresponding biological activities, were designed.},

	abstract = {Computationally assessing the functional similarity between proteins is an important task of bioinformatics research. It can help molecular biologists transfer knowledge on certain proteins to others and hence reduce the amount of tedious and costly benchwork. Representation of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, plays an important role in achieving this goal. Compared with symbolic representation, representing amino acids numerically can expand our ability to analyze proteins, including comparing the functional similarity of them. Among the state-of-the-art methods, electro-ion interaction pseudopotential (EIIP) is widely adopted for the numerical representation of amino acids. However, it could suffer from degeneracy that two different amino acid sequences have the same numerical representation, due to the design of EIIP. In light of this challenge, we propose a complex prime numerical representation (CPNR) of amino acids, inspired by the similarity between a pattern among prime numbers and the number of codons of amino acids. To empirically assess the effectiveness of the proposed method, we compare CPNR against EIIP. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method CPNR always achieves better performance than EIIP. We also develop a framework to combine the advantages of CPNR and EIIP, which enables us to improve the performance and study the unique characteristics of different representations.},

	abstract = {With a large number of DNA and protein sequences already known, the crucial question is to find out how the biological function of these macromolecules is "written" in the sequence of nucleotides or amino acids. Biological processes in any living organism are based on selective interactions between particular bio-molecules, mostly proteins. The rules governing the coding of a protein's biological function, i.e. its ability to selectively interact with other molecules, are still not elucidated. In addition, with the rapid accumulation of databases of protein primary structures, there is an urgent need for theoretical approaches that are capable of analysing protein structure-function relationships. The Resonant Recognition Model (RRM) [,] is one attempt to identify the selectivity of protein interactions within the amino acid sequence. The RRM [,] is a physico-mathematical approach that interprets protein sequence linear information using digital signal processing methods. In the RRM the protein primary structure is represented as a numerical series by assigning to each amino acid in the sequence a physical parameter value relevant to the protein's biological activity. The RRM concept is based on the finding that there is a significant correlation between spectra of the numerical presentation of amino acids and their biological activity. Once the characteristic frequency for a particular protein function/interaction is identified, it is possible then to utilize the RRM approach to predict the amino acids in the protein sequence, which predominantly contribute to this frequency and thus, to the observed function, as well as to design de novo peptides having the desired periodicities. As was shown in our previous studies of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) peptidic antagonists [,] and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) envelope agonists [,], such de novo designed peptides express desired biological function. This study utilises the RRM computational approach to the analysis of oncogene and proto-oncogene proteins. The results obtained have shown that the RRM is capable of identifying the differences between the oncogenic and proto-oncogenic proteins with the possibility of identifying the "cancer-causing" features within their protein primary structure. In addition, the rational design of bioactive peptide analogues displaying oncogenic or proto-oncogenic-like activity is presented here.},
