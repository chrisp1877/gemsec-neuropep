		\subsection{Abstract}\label{abstract}}
	
	The purpose of this documentation is to serve as a reference for the
	motivation, background, methods, and results of the GEMSEC project to
	discover the method of signal transduction in human neuropeptides, to
	ultimately discover candidate peptides with binding affinity to
	graphene, as well as to illuminate their mechanism of binding.
	
	\hypertarget{introduction}{%
		\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}}
	
	The overarching aim of this project is to uncover the mechanism of
	signal transduction in neuropeptides which are experimentally determined
	to bind to graphene. To determine candidate peptides to be experimented
	on, we have utilized three principal methods: cross-sequence entropy,
	PAM30 sequence similarity, and RRM{[}\^{}1{]} relative to two known
	binders, \emph{GrBP5}{[}\^{}2{]} and \emph{M6}{[}\^{}3{]}
	
	\hypertarget{background}{%
		\subsection{Background}\label{background}}
	
	While there is extensive literature surrounding the subject of
	peptide-solid binding and its most important determinants, we have
	focused on two primary methods: sequence domain functionality clustering
	and the \emph{Resonant Recognition Model} proposed by Irena Cosic
	{[}\^{}4{]}.
	
	The \emph{Resonant Recognition Model}, or RRM, is a method proposed by
	Irena Cosic for the analysis of peptides and proteins. The model assumes
	electron-ion interaction potential (EIIP, hereafter) along the backbone
	of amino acid chains to be the most significant deteriminant in a
	peptide or protein's biochemical phenomenological features. For each
	amino acid, a unique scalar EIIP value can be determined, which allows a
	amino acid sequence to be converted to a scalar sequence of EIIP values
	in its most simple form.
	
	\hypertarget{methods}{%
		\subsection{Methods}\label{methods}}
	
	\hypertarget{rrm}{%
		\paragraph{RRM}\label{rrm}}
	
	The Resonant Recognition Model in particular is a physical signal
	processing which interprets a protein or peptide's biological function
	as primarily determined by the corresponding translation numerical
	sequence of EIIP values, justified by the finding that there is
	significant correlation between the spectra of an amino acid sequence
	represented numericaly and its biological activity {[}\^{}3{]}. In our
	computational studies, we have extended the principle underlying Cosic's
	Resonant Recognition Model to another numerical amino acid mapping,
	itself a representation of the amino acid's most significant biological
	characteristic.
	
	From (where?) we used a mapping of the 20 amino acids to seven different
	categories, specifically: aromatic structure, hydrophobic function,
	polar structure, proline (itself), glycine (itself), negative charge,
	positive charge, and Cystine which is excluded (assigned to a separate
	category from all others, like proline and glycine. With the EIIP and
	biological function mapping keys, we were able to derive two unique
	numerical sequences per neuropeptide. From each of these translated
	sequences, following Irena Cosic's RRM construction, we could then
	perform a discrete Fourier transform to determine the spectrum of the
	numerical representation, which generated a characteristic peak in most
	cases which can be considered to be representative of an amino acid
	sequence's biological function.
	
	Because our experiment is principally concerned with the relative
	similarity of sequences to two known graphene-binding peptide sequences
	(GrBP5 and M6), our initial goal was not to determine the biological
	function responsible for graphene binding, but to downselect three
	neuropeptides for experimentation, after which we could apply
	statistical methods to determine the most likely method of binding in
	the case where the candidates are successfully selected binding
	peptides. As such, we followed Cosic's method to determine the cross
	spectrum of each neuropeptide's EIIP and biological mapping spectra, and
	generated a cross spectra with the EIIP and biological mapping spectra
	of GrBP5 and M6. In this cross spectrum, the signal to noise ratio may
	be considered a primitive measure of ``similarity'' in biological
	function between the two peptides, should the RRM be valid in and of
	itself for determining such a function through characteristic peaks,
	because the S/N measures the degree to which constructive interference
	occurs between the two spectra, indicating similar biological function
	(which, in our case, is the potential to bind to graphene).
	
	\hypertarget{cross-entropy}{%
		\paragraph{Cross entropy}\label{cross-entropy}}
	
	We determined the cross entropy for both the pure amino acid sequences
	as well as the functional domain numerical sequences, which can be found
	in the appendix (and which will be generated in the main program).
	
	\hypertarget{pam30-sequence-similarity}{%
		\paragraph{PAM30 Sequence similarity}\label{pam30-sequence-similarity}}
	
	The PAM (point accepted mutation) matrices, initially developed by
	Margaret Dayhoff{[}\^{}5{]} are commonly used in measuring the
	similarity of two peptide or protein sequences. The PAM30 matrix,
	specifically, is a sequence alignment matrix that allows 30 point
	accepted per 100 amino acids. The PAM30 matrix is a ``shallow'' sequence
	alignment matrix, in that it is more appropriate in determining
	alignment for more ``similar'' sequences.
	
	\hypertarget{results}{%
		\subsection{Results}\label{results}}
	
	Fundamentally, our results were calculated on the basis of two
	well-established similarity matrices (the PAM30 substitution matrix and
	the BLOSUM substitution matrix) as well as two key-value lookups
	associating an amino acid with a scalar quantity representing its
	notable biological function (in the case of the statistical clustering
	key:value pairing) or its propensity for electron-ion interaction (in
	the case of EIIP). Since these latter two methods represent our most
	novel foray into characterizing peptide similarity, we first determined
	their correlation to one another. Since the biological function mapping
	is categorical, and the EIIP mapping is continuous, we utilizd the
	Kendall Tau correlation parameter (commonly used to compare categorical
	and continuous data) and found these two mappings to have a correlation
	(tau) of 0.1129 and corresponding p\_value of 0.5083, indicating very
	slight agreement.
	
	\hypertarget{candidate-peptides}{%
		\paragraph{Candidate peptides}\label{candidate-peptides}}
	
	The five similarity metrics generated for each neuropeptide served as a
	feature set which could be weighted and used to train a regression
	model, but without experimental data, the relative weights for each
	feature were chosen by {[}METHOD{]}.
	
	After forwarding the candidate peptides for experimentation, we utilized
	statistical clustering and signal processing methods to predict
	determinant sequence domains in graphene binding which could then be
	used with the experimental data once acquired.
	
	\hypertarget{experimental-results}{%
		\paragraph{Experimental results}\label{experimental-results}}
	
	After generating the list of {[}NUMBER{]} candidate peptides and
	receiving binding affinity metrics, we were then able to perform several
	statistical methods to ascertain the most influential factors in peptide
	graphene binding.
	
	First, we trained a simple linear regression model, using the gathered
	experimental results as training data, and {[}\ldots{}{]}
